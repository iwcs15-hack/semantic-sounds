{"name":"Semantic-sounds","tagline":"Phonetic/semantic similarity stuff","body":"### What we did\r\n\r\nInvestigated the extent to which semantically similar words sound similar.\r\n\r\nFor communication efficiency it is expected that words which are semantically similar will not sound similar (otherwise confusion will ensue).  Word pairs that are semantically/phonetically similar occur because of coincidence and if the usage is rare the evolutionary pressure to change will be low.\r\n\r\nLots of noise in the data.  Filter pairs that have the same word stem.  British/American spelling difference then becomes the largest source of noise.  Then removed pairs where both words were not in the common subset of ispell's US/British words lists.\r\n\r\n### Interesting word pairs\r\n\r\nimplication/ramification\r\n\r\nartifact/artefact\r\n\r\ndecreased/increased\r\n\r\nfaultless/flawless\r\n\r\nastonishingly/astoundingly\r\n\r\nabysmal/dismal\r\n\r\nelusive/illusive\r\n\r\n### Heatmap of data\r\n\r\nBased on 2 million word pairs.\r\n\r\nPhonetic vs semantic similarity.\r\n\r\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iwcs15-hack/semantic-sounds/master/data/sem-phon-gnews.png)\r\n\r\nSimple heat map.\r\n\r\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iwcs15-hack/semantic-sounds/master/data/phon-sem-smooth-gnews.png)\r\n\r\nFilter out words with different spelling in British/US English (0.5 million word pairs).\r\n\r\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iwcs15-hack/semantic-sounds/master/data/phon-sem-brit-US.png)\r\n\r\nWord (i.e., character level) distance vs. semantics.\r\n\r\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iwcs15-hack/semantic-sounds/master/data/word-sem-smooth-gnews.png)\r\n\r\nPhonetic vs character level distance.\r\n\r\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iwcs15-hack/semantic-sounds/master/data/phon-let-smooth-gnews.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
